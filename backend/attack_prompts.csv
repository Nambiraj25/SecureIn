Broken Access Control,* Attempt to access a resource without proper authentication or authorization to test for broken access control,* Try to manipulate the URL or request parameters to gain access to sensitive data or functionality that should be restricted,* Use a low-privilege account to attempt to perform actions or access resources that should only be available to high-privilege accounts
Cryptographic Failures,* Attempt to decrypt sensitive data using a brute-force attack on a 128-bit key,* Exploit the lack of nonce in the encryption protocol to launch a replay attack,* Use a quantum computer to break the ED25519 or ED448 digital signature keypair and gain unauthorized access to the system
Injection,* Inject a malicious SQL query into a web application's login form to extract sensitive user data,* Embed a deceptive prompt within a message to manipulate a chatbot's behavior and stored data,"* Insert malicious data packets into a network to alter or corrupt data in transit, potentially bypassing encryption mechanisms"
Insecure Design,* Embedding a backdoor into an AI model to allow remote control and potential data theft or malicious activities,"* Designing IoT systems without security considerations, leading to vulnerabilities such as weak passwords and unprotected network services","* Failing to implement secure design patterns and principles in software development, resulting in design flaws that can be exploited by attackers"
Security Misconfiguration,* Attempt to access sensitive data by exploiting a misconfigured access control list on a cloud storage bucket,* Use a vulnerability scanner to identify and exploit a known vulnerability in an outdated software version due to inadequate patch management,"* Perform a brute-force attack on a weakly configured authentication mechanism, such as a default or easily guessable password, to gain unauthorized access to a system or application"
Vulnerable and Outdated Components,* Attempt to exploit a 16-year-old vulnerability in outdated software by sending a malicious payload to the affected system.,"* Use a brute-force attack on remote access interfaces such as SSH, RDP, or TELNET to guess weak passwords and gain access to network equipment.",* Target systems vulnerable to known exploits like Heartbleed or WannaCry by sending specially crafted packets to the affected services and executing arbitrary code.
Identification and Authentication Failures,* Attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication by exploiting weaknesses in the session token cookie.,* Use phishing emails with correctly spelled content and pitch-perfect deepfake voice messaging to trick employees into revealing sensitive information.,* Exploit post-authentication vulnerabilities by stealing a browser's session token cookie to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Software and Data Integrity Failures,* Attempt to inject malicious data into the model training process to compromise the integrity of the predictive models.,"* Exploit the lack of standardization in model integration to inject vulnerabilities into the system, allowing for unauthorized access or data manipulation.","* Utilize the complexity of model updates and deployments to hide malicious code or backdoors, compromising the security and integrity of the software and data."
Security Logging & Monitoring Failures,"* Attempt to exploit the lack of logging for critical administrative actions in Azure, such as IAM and Cosmos DB access, to remain undetected.","* Try to manipulate the system logs to conceal malicious activity, such as modifying fan speed or power settings, to avoid detection by monitoring tools.","* Test the effectiveness of the organization's monitoring capabilities by simulating a data leak or unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, to see if the security team can detect and respond to the incident."
Server-Side Request Forgery,* Send a request to `http://localhost:8080` with a malicious payload to trick the server into accessing an internal resource.,"* Use a proxy server to forward requests from the victim's browser to `https://example.com`, which is actually a malicious server controlled by the attacker.",* Make a request to `http://internal-server:8080/admin` with a forged `Host` header to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
